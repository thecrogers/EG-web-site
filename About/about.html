								Welcome to Elm Grove. We hope you find your church home with us, or enjoy your visit if you are from out of town. Here is a little more about us...
							</p>
							<p>
							Elm Grove is an Assembly of God church located in Tolar, TX. We don't have flashing performance lights or a coffee shop, but we love people and love Jesus. Our goal is to serve the church and the community the way that Jesus did.

								</p>
							<p>
								Elm Grove started in a tiny one room school house that we shared with other churches in the early 1900's. The founders of the church got to meet up once a month to worship and read the Gospel until they got a building of their own. Eventually they built their own tiny church to hold services in. You can still stand inside that church, in fact, it's just the entryway we have now. You can see the outline of the old building from the front porch if you look up. We have grown up but not abandoned our roots.
									</p>

					</div>

					<p>
						We seek to be a rural church with a global vision, always aware that the world is full of people who need Jesus and aware that we are called to go and reach them. Mathews 28:19 says, "Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."
